 /*
  * The function `ble_server_uart_task` serves as a BLE server with UART communication capabilities. Here's a summary of what this code does:
  * 1. The task starts and logs a message to indicate that the BLE server UART task has begun. It enters an infinite loop (`for (;;)`) to continuously process UART events.
  * 2. Inside the loop, it waits for a UART event to occur using the `xQueueReceive` function. When a UART event is received, it checks the type of event.
  * 3. If the event type is `UART_DATA`, it reads the data from the UART and stores it in a dynamically allocated buffer (`ntf`). 
  *    The buffer is then used to send notifications to connected BLE clients.
  * 4. It iterates through a loop for each possible BLE connection (up to `CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_MAX_CONNECTIONS` connections).
  * 5. For each connection, it checks if a client has subscribed to notifications (`conn_handle_subs[i]`).
  * 6. If a client has subscribed, it prepares a BLE notification message (`txom`) containing the UART data and sends it to the client using the `ble_gatts_notify_custom` function.
  * 7. It logs whether the notification was sent successfully or if there was an error. The loop continues processing UART events, and the task repeats.
  * 8. Finally, the task is deleted using `vTaskDelete(NULL)` when it is no longer needed.
